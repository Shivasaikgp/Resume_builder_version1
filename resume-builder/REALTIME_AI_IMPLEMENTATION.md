## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
-- AI Feedback tracking table
CREATE TABLE "AIFeedback" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "userId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "suggestionId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "action" TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'accepted', 'rejected', 'modified'
    "originalContent" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "finalContent" TEXT,
    "context" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "section" TEXT,
    "userContext" JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    "sessionId" TEXT,
    "timestamp" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT "AIFeedback_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

### API Endpoints

   - Shows AI processing indicators
   - Handles suggestion application

## Performance Optimizations

### Debouncing Strategy
- Configurable debounce timing (default 800ms)
- Minimum content length threshold (default 15 characters)
- Automatic cleanup of pending requests

### Streaming Optimization
